    <li>The prime land is now at the center of a vicious legal battle pitting the United States International University-Africa (USIU-A) against businessman George Kiongera and late President Moi.</li>
    <li>Dr. Mwangi, through Muthaiga Luxury Homes Ltd, has sued USIU-A, Mr. Moi, Mr. Kiongera's Maestro Connections Health Systems Limited, the Chief Lands Registrar, the Director of Survey and the Attorney General.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="align--justify">
  Equity Bank Chief Executive officer James Mwangi has told the High Court that he bought the 20-acre piece of land from the late President Daniel arap Moi for Sh300 million in February 2012.
  </p>
  <p class="align--justify">Testifying before Justice David Mugo Mwangi of the Environment and Land Court (ELC) division, Dr&nbsp;Mwangi said he had two meetings with the late president over the land.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">"I visited the late president twice and we discussed the purchase of the land. He was happy that I had completed payment of the purchase price on time," Dr&nbsp;Mwangi told the magistrate on Wednesday.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">Led in his evidence by lawyer William Githara, the bank boss told the court that "the late president expressed gratitude that I completed payment for the land on time as he used the money to settle some family matters.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">He said the late president even told him during their discussions that he even knew there was another piece of land to his (Moi's) and "that I was going to do a big project".</p>
  <p class="align--justify">The witness said the former leader told him that he knew that he (Dr&nbsp;Mwangi) was friends with his son Gideon, the immediate former senator for Baringo.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">"We talked with the late Moi for an hour and a half. We touched on a range of issues from family matters to the funding of the Kabarak University Insurance Program."</p>
  <p class="align--justify">Dr. Mwangi said when he agreed to buy the land, their family lawyer, Ms. Mary Kiarie, started preparing documents and payments.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">"During your visits to Mr. Moi, did he ever say that he never received the money you paid for the land?" Mr. Githara asked Dr. Mwangi.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">"No, he never told me that he had not received the money. Instead, he thanked me for making the payment on time and told me that the money helped him settle some family obligations," Dr. Mwangi recalled.</p>
    <p class="align--justify">He told the judge that the property was bought by the family company Muthaiga Luxury Homes Limited and that "all payments to Mr. Moi were channeled through the family lawyer Ms. Mary Kiarie".</p>
    <p class="align--justify">He said he paid the total amount of Sh300 million and a stamp duty of Sh12 million to the Lands ministry.</p>
    <p class="align--justify">He added, however, that he "does not know when the the transaction was completed".</p>
    <p class="align--justify">Dr. Mwangi said he believed the transaction was genuine between him and the late Moi and that he was "entitled to own it".</p>
   <p class="align--justify">The bank boss said he is aware that Maestro Connections Health Systems Limited also claims to have bought the same piece of land.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">He added that he is also aware that Maestro borrowed Sh158,250,000 from Equity Bank Limited (EBL) and that the bank's managing director Warui and Mary Wamae signed for the loan on behalf of the bank.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">Dr. Mwangi said he never borrowed money from the bank to buy the property which is also being claimed by United States International University (USIU).</p>
   <p class="align--justify">The bank boss, who explained that he is not involved in the day-to-day management and operations of EBL, denied that he was involved in the discussions that approved the loan to Maestro.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">He even added that he only reports to Equity Group shareholders on its investments and new business ventures.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">"As group CEO, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of the bank but I monitor the performance of the investments," Dr. Mwangi said in response to a question from his lawyer, Mr. Githara.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">The bank chief told the judge that when the ownership dispute arose, he tried in vain to reach the late president and that Gideon Moi refused to discuss the Muthaiga land issue with him.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">"Mr. Moi was mostly at his Kabarak home during his last days and I could not reach him to discuss the matter," Dr. Mwangi testified.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">He said it was during this period that Moi's property manager approached him (Mwangi) and agreed to sell him the same property.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">"I told the property manager that I had been sold the property by Mr. Moi himself and then I referred him to my lawyer (Mary Kiarie)," Dr. Mwangi recounted.</p>
   <p class="align--justify">In his testimony, he gave a graphic account of how he visited Mr. Moi and that at one point "he was given a golden pen and ink".</p>
   <p class="align--justify">Asked by his lawyer what he wanted from the court, he said he wanted the truth because his dealings with the late president were honest and genuine.</p>
<p class="align--justify">"Why are you in court and what do you want this court to do," Mr. Githara asked Dr. Mwangi.</p>
<p class="align--justify">In response, he said: "I urge this court to find that the transaction between me and Moi was genuine, that I am the legal and genuine owner of the property. I urge this court to find my evidence credible. That is all."</p>
<p class="align--justify">The prime land is now at the center of a vicious legal battle pitting the United States International University-Africa (USIU-A) against businessman George Kiongera and late President Moi.</p>
<p class="align--justify">In the case, Dr. Mwangi, through Muthaiga Luxury Homes Ltd, has sued USIU-A, Mr. Moi, Mr. Kiongera's Maestro Connections Health Systems Limited, the Chief Lands Registrar, the Director of Survey and the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="align--justify">Mr. Kiongera and USIU-A also claim to have bought the land from Mr. Moi for Sh500 million.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">Dr. Mwangi says he only learnt from press reports that Mr. Kiongera and USIU-A had both laid claim to the piece of land for which he paid Sh300 million in 2012.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">Court papers show that Mr. Moi was represented in the transaction by businessman Andrew Sunkuli.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">Dr. Mwangi says he bought the property through his company, Muthaiga Luxury Homes.</p>
  <p class="align--justify">He attached the sale agreement and transfer documents with Mr. Moi's signature because "prior to the purchase, Muthaiga Luxury Homes conducted an official search of the property at the Central Land Registry and established that the same belonged to Mr. Moi and was unencumbered and therefore available for sale," Dr. Mwangi said in court papers.</p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-base text-[#535862]">
    <li>The banks are fighting over a single property in Riruta that is registered in different names and was used to secure over Sh450 million loans.</li>
    <li>Judges say the banks appear to have been caught up in an intricate web of a fraudulent syndicate, hatched by their mutual customers.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The Court of Appeal is set to hear a title deed theft racket case that has left three banks fighting over a single property in Riruta that is registered in different names and was used to secure over Sh450 million loans.</p>
<p>In the case described by judges as interesting but also perplexing, Equity Bank #ticker:EQTY, Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) and Cooperative Bank of Kenya #ticker:COOP, are laying claim on the land.</p>
<p>The judges noted that the banks appear to have been caught up in an intricate web of a fraudulent syndicate, hatched by their mutual customers.</p>
<p>“In the process, the banks are staring at a possibility of losing hundreds of millions of shillings of customer funds. The syndicate, we are told, has also hit other banks in the country, and it is perplexing that none of the perpetrators has been subjected to the criminal process. Perhaps it is a measure of how high the country has soared in the corruption index,”said justices Philip Waki, Mohamed Warsame and Patrick Kiage.</p>
<p>They said the circumstances surrounding the dispute between the three banks are fraught with fraud, which neither lender may be strictly responsible for because they all believed they held a first charge on the plot in Riruta measuring approximately 0.2 hectares.</p>
<p>CBA moved to the Court of Appeal after High Court judge Samson Okong’o allowed Cooperative to sell the land to recover its money. The judges granted Co-op the injunction pending the hearing of the case.</p>
<p>Evidence presented to court showed that on April 8, 2010, Mr Patrick Njuguna, Mr Edward Njuguna and Mr George James Kireru Kangethe, all trading as Patrick Kangethe &amp; Sons, went to Co-op and borrowed about Sh166 million. As a security, they deposited an original title, which was registered in the name of Patrick on August 29, 1997.</p>
<p>A legal first charge was duly registered against the title on September 10, 2010, and there were no other obstacles. The bank still has in its possession, the original documents.</p>
<p>On October 23, 2012, another original title with the same plot number registered in the name of Wardpa Holdings Ltd (WHL) was obtained by its directors. They are Mr Edward, George and Ms Gladys Njeri Kangethe.</p>
<p>They went to CBA on March 24, 2013 and borrowed about Sh100 million on the security of that title and a legal charge was also registered against the document.</p>
<p>CBA through its lawyer William Kabaiku, said appropriate searches were carried out and there was no evidence of any other previous charge on the title. The bank, he said, retains the original documents.</p>
<p>About a year later, in May, 2014, yet another original title was obtained in the name of Kinjunje Gardens Ltd (KGL) whose directors are Patrick and his wife Margaret Wambui Kangethe.</p>
<p>They went to Equity on December 9, 2014 and borrowed a Sh200 million loan, a legal charge was registered against the title on January 23, 2015. Like CBA, Equity said it carried out searches and found no evidence of prior issues with the title. They also retain the original documents.</p>
<p>Justice Okongo noted that all the loans that were advanced on the security of plot no.2289 were advanced to people who knew each other or were related and were working together in pursuit of the loans.</p>
<p>The judge added that it was also apparent that without the complicity of the office of the Chief Land Registrar, the transactions on plot 2289 would not have taken the trajectory they did.</p>
<p>In May 20, 2016, Co-op bank instructed Leaky Auctioneers to advertise plot 2289 for sale, to recover the amount due in excess of Sh195 million.</p>
<p>The family tried to block the sale by seeking an injunction in case filed in Mombasa, but the matter was dismissed. The sale was re-advertised and that is when Equity and CBA realized that it was the security given to them that was being sold.</p>
<p>Equity filed suit in the Environment and Land Court against KGL and its two directors, Co-op bank, Leakey's auctioneers, and the Chief Land Registrar.</p>
<p>CBA also filed a different case against WHL, and one of the directors (Patrick), Co-op bank, Leakey's auctioneers and the Chief Land Registrar. They both asserted that the intention by Co- op bank to sell the property was illegal, null and void since they never gave their consent for creation of any charge on the property besides theirs.</p>
<p>The two banks also claimed that the charge held by Co-op bank was on a fake and parallel Title. After hearing the case, Justice Okongo found no reason to stop Co-op bank from exercising its statutory power of sale and set it free to proceed with the auction.</p>
<p>The Judge reasoned that if any charges were created on fraudulent fake titles, then those were the charges created by CBA and Equity since the charge in favour of Co-op bank was first in time. The other titles, he said, did not exist when Co-op bank registered the Charge and it could not therefore be parallel to the other Charges.</p>
<p>The decision forced CBA to move to the Court of Appeal arguing that the intended appeal raised serious issues on the exercise of the trial court's discretion.</p>
<p>Mr Kabaiku said CBA will argue that the finding that the Charge of Co-op bank was "first in time" was erroneous since all the three charges were on different original Titles on the same parcel of land which were fraudulently obtained.</p>
<p>The lawyer said CBA was as much a victim of the syndicate as Co-op bank and Equity and all should have an equal opportunity of mitigating the possible loss.</p>
<p>The court said there is no clarity on how the three original titles were obtained or how consents were obtained from the local Land Control Board for validation of the charges.</p>
<p>According to the judges, the principle of “first in time” may well be called to question in the circumstances. “Furthermore, the huge amount of money given out in loans does not belong to the banks but to their customers. There is, in our view, considerable interest by a large bank customer base, if not general public interest, and therefore the need for circumspection,” they added.</p>

    title: "Equity bank vs NCBA bank on Downtown Nairobi property",
    date: "December 8, 2023",
    description: "Queries on due diligence as banks fight over collateral.",
    content: `<p>A rising number of clashes by banks claiming rights over the same property marked for auction has turned the focus on due diligence practices by lenders before accepting such assets as collateral.<br>Collateral is an asset that a lender accepts as security for extending a loan. If the borrower defaults, then the lender may seize the collateral. Accepting collateral against loans requires a lender to audit such assets for financial safety before entering into a proposed transaction with another party.</p>

<p>In the latest feud, Equity Bank and NCBA Bank are caught in a fierce fight for the sale of a property in downtown Nairobi after the two lenders lost to Co-operative Bank in a similar racket three years ago.<br>NCBA won the first round of the battle after High Court judge David Majanja rejected Equity’s application to review a ruling made in July, allowing NCBA to auction the property to recover a loan of Sh160 million.</p>

<p>This is the second case in which the two lenders are embroiled in a property fight, incidentally involving some of the parties that were entangled in the duel that Co-operative Bank won in 2019.<br>In the case pending before the High Court, both Equity and NCBA claim they each granted a loan of Sh160 million to Kinjunje Gardens Ltd.</p>

<h2>Forgery claims</h2>

<p>Equity Bank claimed that the charge registered by NCBA for a loan that was borrowed in June 2014 was forged. NCBA on its part maintains that its charge is valid but the one presented by Equity is forged. Justice David Majanja, however, rejected Equity’s bid to stop the auction planned by NCBA to recover its money.</p>

<p>The property comprises a hotel and attendant facilities. Kinjunje Gardens had also opposed the sale saying any disruption of the business would be disastrous to the sustainability of the business.<br>In the ruling, Justice Majanja said it was difficult at this stage to conclude who is telling the truth.</p>

<p>The judge said it is expected that both lenders did due diligence before advancing the money to Kinjunje. Equity went for a review of the earlier decision that a sale agreement tabled by NCBA was a forgery and the discovery of the new facts was significant as it challenges the validity of NCBA’s charge.</p>

<p>The evidence is that Henkam Ltd, which sold the property to Kinjunje allegedly received payment from Equity and not NCBA and that the previous owner never executed the sale agreement dated January 20, 2014, which formed the basis of the sale of the property, financed by NCBA.<br>In a ruling in July, Justice Majanja noted that NCBA’s charge was registered on July 18, 2014, while Equity Bank’s was registered on October 9, 2014.</p>

<p>He said on the face of it, NCBA’s security must prevail as he declined to stop NCBA from selling the property.<br>NCBA said there was nothing new in the evidence as claimed by Equity as it was available to all parties from the onset.</p>

<p>“It follows that even if I were to accept that the material and evidence proffered by Equity is new, it is not important because it is not based on what is pleaded and no relief is sought by Equity against the suit property,” the judge said<br>Evidence produced in court was that Kinjunje approached NCBA for a loan of Sh160 million in June 2014 to purchase the property on Tom Mboya Street.</p>

<h2>Loan default</h2>

<p>The property was charged to the bank and Kinjunje defaulted on the loan repayment, forcing NCBA to think of auctioning the property.<br>NCBA said the debt now stands Sh286.5 million as of June 2021. The bank said it was fair and just that it be allowed to exercise its right to sell and proceed with the auction as scheduled.</p>

<p>But Equity claimed NCBA’s claim was invalid because the property was already charged to it when Kinjunje allegedly obtained the loan from Equity.<br>Equity added as the first ‘chargee’ and under the principle of “the first in time prevails”, its charge ranks higher than that of NCBA in the recovery of dues owed by Kinjunje Gardens.</p>

<p>The judge noted that the parties accused each other of fraud, forgery, and illegalities concerning the title deeds and securities, but all the claims can be determined after a full hearing.<br>In the case that was settled in 2019, a bench of three judges ruled in favour of Co-op, which was allowed to sell the property owned by Wardpa Holdings, Kinjunje, and some of its directors.</p>

<p>All three banks had given the companies a total of Sh450 million, which was advanced on different dates and charged the same property to secure the loans.<br>Equity lost the fight for the property at the High Court and failed to pursue the appeal although it was joined in the case by NCBA.</p>

<p>“In the process, the banks are staring at the possibility of losing hundreds of millions of shillings of customer funds. The syndicate, we are told, has also hit other banks in the country, and it is perplexing that none of the perpetrators has been subjected to the criminal process. Perhaps it is a measure of how high the country has soared in the corruption index,” the three judges who heard the case said.</p>
<p>According to the court, the circumstances surrounding the dispute between the three banks are fraught with fraud, which neither of the banks may be strictly responsible for because they all believed they held a first charge on the plot.<br>Evidence in court showed that on April 8, 2010, Patrick Kangethe &amp; Sons, went to Co-op bank and borrowed about Sh166 million. As security, they deposited the original title to the land, which was registered in the name of Patrick on August 29, 1997.</p>
<p>A legal first charge was duly registered against the title on September 10, 2010, and there were no other encumbrances on the title. The bank still has in its possession, the original documents.<br>On October 23, 2012, another original title with the same plot number registered in the name of Wardpa Holdings Ltd (WHL) was obtained by the Directors of WHL. They went to CBA on March 24, 2013, and borrowed about Sh100 million on the security of that title and a legal charge was registered against it.</p>
<p>NCBA said appropriate searches were carried out and there was no evidence of any other previous charge on the title. The bank, he said, retains the original documents.<br>About one year later, in May 2014, yet another original title with the same plot number was obtained in the name of Kinjunje Gardens Ltd.</p>
<h2>Legal charge</h2>
<p>They went to Equity on December 9, 2014, and borrowed a loan of Sh200 million, and a legal charge was registered against the title on January 23, 2015.<br>Like NCBA, Equity said it carried out searches and found no evidence of prior encumbrances on the Title. They also retain the original documents.</p>
<p>Environment and Land Court judge Samson Okongo noted that all the loans that were advanced on the security of the plot were given to people who knew each other or were related and were working together in pursuit of the said loans.<br>On May 20, 2016, Co-op bank instructed Leaky Auctioneers to advertise the sale of the plot, to recover the amount due of more than Sh195 million. It was then that Equity and NCBA moved to court to challenge the planned sale.</p>
<p>NCBA and Equity claimed that the charge held by the Co-op bank was on a fake and parallel title. After hearing the case, Justice Okongo found no reason to stop Co-op bank from exercising its statutory power of sale and set it free to proceed with the auction.</p>
<p>Co-op won the case at the High Court and a subsequent appeal as the courts ruled that there was no evidence of fraud on the part of the Co-operative bank and the lender could go ahead and sell the property.</p>
<p>“In conclusion, we would agree with the finding of the learned Judge that the appellant did not demonstrate a prima facie case of fraud that may lead to the nullification of the charge in favour of the Co-op Bank at the trial or that damages would not be an adequate remedy,” a bench of three judges of the Court of Appeal ruled.</p>

    date: "June 5,2023",
    description:
      "The Supreme Court of Kenya considers the due diligence obligations placed on a “bona fide purchaser” under Kenya's land laws.",
    content: `<p><em>The Supreme Court in Dina Management Limited vs. County Government of Mombasa &amp; 5 Others</em> [SC Petition No.8 (E010) of 2021], considered the question of the level of due diligence that should be undertaken to support a claim that one is a bona fide purchaser of land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bona fide purchaser is one who buys something for value without notice of another’s claim to the property and without actual or constructive notice of any defects in or infirmities, claims, or equities against the seller’s title.</p>
<h2>The Land Registration Act (LRA)</h2>
<p>Section 26 of the LRA provides that a certificate of title shall be taken by all courts as prima facie evidence that the person named as a proprietor of land is the absolute and indefeasible owner of such land, except in the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>if the proprietor was party to the fraud or misrepresentation leading to issuance of the certificate of title; or&nbsp;</li>
    <li>where the certificate of title has been acquired <strong>illegally, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>The facts</h2>
<p>The County Government of Mombasa challenged the validity of the title for the property, known as MN/1/6053 belonging to Dina Management Limited situated in Nyali Beach (the <strong>Property</strong>), on the grounds that the first owner of the Property had obtained the title in 1989 through unprocedural means and that the Property was public land reserved for a public road. As such, the County entered the Property and demolished the perimeter wall facing the beachfront to create a public right of way to the beach.</p>
<p>Dina Management Limited, being the third owner of the Property, challenged the actions of the County Government claiming that it was a bona fide purchaser for value, having paid KES.18 million to acquire the Property. In its defence, Dina Management Limited indicated that it was not party to the unprocedural process of acquiring the title and had undertaken its due diligence before acquiring the said title.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Court’s decision</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Property was a public utility incapable of giving rise to a private proprietary interest capable of being protected by a court of law.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court additionally noted that the title to the Property was:</p>
<ul>
    <li>freehold title contrary to the provisions of the Government Land Act (Repealed) which provided that the leases of town plots should only be granted for any term not exceeding one hundred years; and</li>
    <li>the Property was an open space which had been set aside for “public purpose” and therefore, could not be considered as “unalienated land” meaning its ownership could not be transferred.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Court also highlighted the decision of the Court of Appeal in Samuel Kamere v. Lands Registrar, [Kajiado Civil Appeal No. 28 of 2005 [2015] eKLR] which stated as follows:</p>
<p>“…in order to be considered a bona fide purchaser for value, they must prove; that they acquired a VALID and LEGAL title, secondly,<strong> they carried out the necessary due diligence to determine the lawful owner from whom they acquired a legitimate title</strong> and thirdly that they paid valuable consideration for the purchase of the suit property…”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court concluded that Dina Management Limited could not benefit from the defence that it was a bona fide purchaser as it ought to have “been more cautious in undertaking its due diligence” noting that the Property, “by its very nature being a beach property, was always bound to be attractive and lucrative” and therefore its right to property as per Article 40(6) of the Constitution of Kenya and the land therefore automatically vests in the Mombasa County pursuant to Article 62(2) of the Constitution.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To benefit from the defence of that one is a bona fide purchaser of land, a purchaser shall now be required to take such steps as necessary to investigate the history of the land and “go to the root of the title” as opposed to simply concluding that the title held by the seller is evidence of the seller’s absolute and indefeasible title.</p>
<p>Such steps could include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>requesting allotment letters and similar documents in certain cases where a question on whether the land could be public land could arise;</li>
    <li>undertaking customary searches at the Lands Office and requesting for an inspection of the files in respect of the Property at the Lands Office;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>engaging a surveyor to undertake appropriate searches at the Survey of Kenya; and</li>
    <li>checking whether the Property is listed in the Ndungu Report on Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land in Kenya).</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements set out above raise doubts on the Torrens System of Land Registration adopted in Kenya which is premised on the fact that the register maintained by the Government is conclusive evidence of the title of the person who is registered as the owner of land and that one does not need to “go to the root of the title” to establish such title.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also unclear how the judgment will affect titles taken as security by financiers and the obligations and costs to purchasers of land in seeking to undertake due diligence that would meet the criteria set by the Supreme Court in this matter.&nbsp;</p>

    <li>The KDF insists that it owns the land, which is known as KDF Roysambu Camp.</li>
    <li>Sidhi Investments wants Uchumi compelled to honour a 2005 sale agreement in which the company was to buy the property for Sh118 million.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) and Uchumi Supermarkets are locked in a standoff after the military took over a Sh2.8 billion piece of prime land, which the struggling retailer is in the process of selling to a church.</p>
<p>Five months ago Uchumi reached an agreement with Jesus Winners Ministry to sell the 20-acre land on Thika Road for Sh2.8 billion.</p>
<p>The land, which gave Roysambu estate its name, is tucked between Thika Road Mall and Safari Park hotel.</p>
<p>Jesus Winners Ministry was buying the land through its investment arm, Jewel Complex Limited. The company paid a Sh330 million deposit in November.</p>
<p>However, two weeks ago KDF moved onto the land whose ownership has been in contention since 1985. The soldiers have since pitched tent and are keeping vigil day and night.</p>
<p><strong>DEBTS</strong></p>
<p>They have even brought in some military hardware, such as trucks, and placed a tank and sand bags at the entrance of the land.</p>
<p>By Wednesday the soldiers had completed putting up a fence around the property in green military colours.</p>
<p>Struggling Uchumi was expecting to use proceeds of the sale to offset its over <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/business/996-5074870-atci3e/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sh3.6 billion debts</a>.</p>
<p>The supermarket, which is on the brink of collapse, has been fighting an insolvency petition filed by its suppliers last year.</p>
<p>Uchumi chief executive officer Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed said he had initiated talks with the KDF.</p>
<p>“The Kenya Defence Forces has occupied the Kasarani land. We are engaging them to resolve the issue. We are confident that this matter will soon be resolved,” said Mr Mohamed.</p>
<p><strong>SIDHI SPURNED</strong></p>
<p>The KDF insists that it owns the land, which is known as KDF Roysambu Camp. “The ongoing activities at the camp are a routine military exercise,” KDF spokesman Paul Njuguna told the <em>Nation</em>.</p>
<p>“The land on which the camp is situated belongs to the Ministry of Defence,” he said.</p>
<p>Ironically, KDF’s move comes at a time when Uchumi is fighting a court battle with another company that it entered a sale deal with, only to clinch another pact with the church after receiving a deposit.</p>
<p>Sidhi Investments wants Uchumi compelled to honour a 2005 sale agreement in which the company was to buy the property for Sh118 million.</p>
<p>Sidhi had paid a 10 per cent deposit before the deal flopped. Uchumi has previously successfully fought off attempts by two squatter groups that claimed to own the land LR 5875/2.</p>
<p><strong>OWNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>The retailer bought the land from Solio Construction Company in 2001 through their wholly-owned Kasarani Mall Limited.</p>
<p>The National Land Commission (NLC) however flagged the transaction in 2017.</p>
<p>The NLC investigations found that Solio Construction had twice acquired ownership documents for the land before the lease to its previous owner — Meshumor Jacob — had expired.</p>
<p>Mr Jacob’s 99-year lease was to expire in 2003, according to the NLC probe. The government’s initial intention was to build a military school on the property.</p>
<p>The Department of Defence, however, said the land was unsuitable for the school. The acquisition failed when Mr Jacob sued the government.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal in 1997 ordered that the government and Mr Jacob negotiate out of court.</p>

    content: `<p class="video-desc">A Nairobi court has extended orders seeking the arrest of a former provincial commissioner accused of forging documents with plans to fraudulently acquire a parcel of land in Loresho valued at Sh1.3 billion.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Trial magistrate Dolphina Alego issued the warrant for the arrest of Davis Nathan Chelogoi last year after failing to appear in court for plea taking over alleged conspiracy to defraud Ashok Rupshi Shah and Hitenkumar Amritlal Raja of an 18-acre parcel of land on Lower Kabete Road.</p>
<p class="video-desc">A co-accused- Andrew Kirungu, a senior official at the ministry of Lands, was released after paying cash bail of Sh1.5 million after denying the charges.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Kirungu, an assistant director land administrator and Chelogoi are accused of procuring the registration of the contested land, by falsely pretending that it belongs to the former administrator.</p>
<p class="video-desc">The charge sheet stated that they committed the offence on diverse dates between December 9, 2020 and June 4, 2021.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Kirungu was also accused of causing the fraudulent registration of certificate of Title L.R. No. 18485 1.R. No.232908 in abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Chelogoi has been fighting over the ownership of the land since 2009 but lost the fight when the Environment and Land Court ruled that it was grabbed by late businessman Jacob Juma in 2008.</p>
<p class="video-desc">The court ruled last year that Juma, who died in May 2016, obtained documents to the land fraudulently.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Justice Loise Komingoi then ordered the cancellation of the face documents and directed Juma’s widow – Miriam Wairimu to compensate Shah and Kumar Sh50 million as damages for trespass and for denying the real owners the right to enjoy their property.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Chelogoi later sought to quash the decision arguing that he was condemned unheard but his application to reopen the case was rejected. He was, however, allowed to join the case for the purpose of filing an appeal.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Shah and Kumar moved to court in 2009 arguing that Juma fraudulently took over the land, fenced it and built security houses to deny them access.</p>
<p class="video-desc">The former PC claimed that he was allocated the land by former President Daniel Moi in 1995.</p>
<p class="video-desc">But investigations later revealed that Mr Kirungu assisted Chelogoi procure the registration fraudulently.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Following the decision last year, Ashok says he later discovered that Chelogoi had filed a separate claim over the land using fraudulent documents.</p>
<p class="video-desc">Through his lawyers Macharia Mwangi &amp; Njeru Advocates, Ashok said he applied for the reconstruction of the records at the Ministry of Lands only to discover that the records have been interfered with by unscrupulous persons.</p>

      "Geo-referencing of land parcels will eradicate fake titles – President Kenyatta.",
    content:`<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that the on-going geo-referencing of land parcels will bring to an end the issuance of fake title deeds.</p>
<p>In his Mashujaa Day address at Wang’uru Stadium in Kirinyaga, President Kenyatta said the exercise, which is a facet of an entire digitisation programme, has so far unearthed deeply-rooted wanton illegalities including the improper allocation of government-owned parcels of land to private citizens.</p>
<p>“For 125 years, our land registry was manually managed and very messy. In fact, some of this mess was deliberate, engineered to facilitate land theft and corruption. But with the help of this youth-led team, we have begun the process of digitising the land registry.</p>
<p>“What has surprised us as we reference title deeds with geographical co-ordinates is the historical fraud that has existed in our land sector. We have found private land titles to roundabouts in major highways, private land titles on airport runways, and all of this is because titles were issued without reference to geographical co-ordinates or what experts call geo-referencing,” he said.</p>
<p>He stated that government was in the process of cleaning title deeds to ensure they have corresponding geographical co-ordinates in an effort to stamp out fake titles and restore the sanctity of the title deed.</p>
<p>The exercise includes cross-referencing coordinates recorded on existing title deeds against an in-built cadastre on Ardhisasa land management system to identify its exact location. This means that for every parcel of land on paper, there should be a physical piece of land on the ground that is in an area available for private ownership.</p>
<p>This will ensure that all parcels which are located on public land, road reserves, riparian land and other government-owned parcels are not available for transaction.</p>
<p>In the recent past, Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney has said that the system has been meticulously designed to root out corruption and ensure only “clean parcels” are available for transaction.</p>
<p>“The challenge we are having currently is that some of the parcels especially in Nairobi were illegally allocated, and this is as a result of decades of corruption in the land sector. The system that we have built however is incorruptible. This is the Mercedes of deployment technology, and as such it will make it impossible for anyone to conduct illegal land transactions,” she said in a past meeting.</p>
<p>On functionality, President Kenyatta said Ardhisasa would cut down the amount of time taken to conduct land transactions from a minimum of six months to 48 hours, with the time taken to obtain a land search being reduced from 3 months to 3-5 minutes. Consequently, the country is expected to achieve a higher ranking in the ease of doing business index.</p>
<p>Highlighting the progress in another one of his land reform agendas, National Titling Programme, President Kenyatta exuded confidence of further increasing the number of title deeds he will issue before leaving office due to the transition from manual to digital mode of land transactions.</p>
<p>“Now with digitisation, we have the platform to ensure that every inch of Kenya is mapped and all areas eligible for allocation and issuance of titles have an accurate, secure and fraud-free system of issuance.</p>
<p>“It is my belief that after digitisation, issues of land titling will be sorted out once and for all. And I say so because my administration has already issued 5.3 million title deeds under the manual registry in only 8 years. That is equivalent to the number of title deeds issued by the colonizers and the first three administrations combined in a total of 125 years. So I believe that if we have achieved 5.3 million titles in 8 years under an archaic system, how much more will we be able to achieve once the national system is completely digitised?” he remarked.</p>

    title: "Land title deeds conversion process kicks-off",

    description: "The conversion of title deeds timely and long overdue.",
    content: `<p class="text-lg font-semibold">What you need to know</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-base text-[#535862]">
    <li>A gazette notice last December, anchored on a Land Registration order of November 2017, kick-started the process of converting Kenya’s title deeds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A gazette notice last December, anchored on a Land Registration order of November 2017, kick-started the process of converting Kenya’s title deeds, previously issued under multiple legal regimes, to a single regime under the Land Registration Act of 2012.</p>

<p>When the notice hit public space early this month, there was anxiety and confusion about what the conversion was about, and whether it doesn’t provide an opportunity for the dispossession of landowners. There was concern that it may open a window for mischief by unscrupulous officials, middlemen and quacks who have muddled up our land administration system for long.</p>

<p>These concerns were valid. Until then, there was a big information gap, and hardly any public sensitisation on the matter.</p>

<p>But the coordinating state Ministry of Land and Physical Planning moved with speed to mitigate these gaps. Cabinet secretary Farida Karoney issued a prompt and comprehensive public statement whose content was widely covered in the local media. It also circulated widely on social media. The statement, along with extra information, including FAQs, was quickly posted on the ministry’s website (www.lands.go.ke) to help debunk pertinent public concerns. This makes it easy to establish that the exercise will be countrywide, is phased and commences with Nairobi County, and is intended to end in December.</p>

<p>The process requires landowners holding title deeds or leases not issued under the Land Registration Act to apply for migration of such documents for conformity. Applicants will not be required to pay any statutory fees. The ownership details, size and any registered interests on the land won’t be changed and will remain as on the old titles.</p>

<p>But what’s the background and justification to this? Kenya’s 2010 Constitution required that the existing land laws be revised, consolidated or rationalised. This was because the laws were many, and some were inconsistent and incompatible. Subsequently, substantive land law was collapsed into the Land Act for public and private land. Substantive law on community land is now anchored in the Community Land Act. The various land registration laws which had been used in parallel since formal law was applied to our jurisdiction were repealed under the Land Registration Act. This law now provides for the registration of all rights to land in Kenya.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this law provided for the use of a cadastral map to be maintained for each registration unit. The ministry’s statement clarifies that the Registry Index Map will now be used as the cadastral map to support registration of title under the Land Registration Act.</p>

<p>Therefore, a situation where we would continue to have some ownership documents issued under the repealed Indian Transfer of Property Act, Land Titles Act, Registration of Titles Act, Government Lands Act or Registered Land Act, some with deed plans as the supporting map, in routine use, would be anomalous. Indeed, this migration was long overdue. There’ll be challenges too. But it behoves the ministry, stakeholders and titleholders to resolve these as they emerge.</p>
